A common pattern is writing code which is expected to work with several types of collections of data, for instance. This expectation is however in the mind of the programmer (at least without type annotations), and not something that the interpreter will enforce until runtime. This provides a lot of flexibility, but also requires us to understand what our code means for the different kinds of input.
